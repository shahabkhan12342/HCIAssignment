    <h2 id="part1">PRORJECT TITLE : ERP SYSTEM FOR RESTAURANTS</h2>
    <h3>PROBLEM:</h3><br>
    <h4>MISMANAGEMENT AND DELAY IN ORDER:</h4>
        <p>The problem we first face when we go to restaurant is waste of time in waiting to place and receive an order especially in peak times when there are lots of people. This is also cause waiters to deliver wrong orders which is problem for both restaurants and people who go to eat there.<br>
    
    <h4>Customer Satisfaction:</h4>
        <p>The traditional way to engagement/ feedback make it difficult for customer to complain about waiters to wait itself, many customers hesitate and many waiters don’t take query to management which cause lack of quality management.
    <br>
    <h4>Food Spices Customization:</h4>
      <p>  In most of the applications or websites, people can just order their food, they cannot customize it according to what they want.
    </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>TARGET USERS:</h3>
<p> Target users of this project will be those customers who will visit that restaurant and scan QR code to access website and order their food using it.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>SOLUTION:</h3><br>
 <h4>E-menu and Automation:</h4>
  <p>
    Electronic menu and ordering of food will eliminate the hassle of delays and wrong ordering and will also provide great details on the items present in the menu as well as pictures or videos for them. This feature automates the process of ordering food and will also be beneficial if the restaurant wants automation in more of its departments.
It also eliminates the need for waiters since the complete process from order taking to payment can all be done on the app.
The app also aims to provide complete tracking of order for both parties. The customer will be aware and will be notified if its order is ready or how much time he will have to wait for it. The management will have all records starting from the status of tables to ordering of food, its delivery and payment to the point where the customer leaves.</p>
<h4>Personalized ordering:</h4>
<p>Personalization of food for individual person according to one’s unique taste is also another feature offered to the customer giving the complete authority over the food they are ordering
</p>
<h4>ERP and Assistance:</h4>

<p>ERP System for better management and improvement. To assist the management in getting better profits we provide the facility for not just point of sale but inventory management as well as cost to sale reports and profit calculation. AI assist will be the core feature for the management, which guide towards better side for the restaurant. The reports will generate on daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis for understanding and overcome the flaws to improve profits.
